## 📌 Overview

A simple and efficient To-Do List app built with Next.js and TypeScript, themed after Blossom from The Powerpuff Girls (never watched it lol)! This application helps users manage tasks by adding, and deleting them with a clean UI, featuring a pink and stylish aesthetic inspired by Blossom. I need to implement edit feature at some point!

## 🚀 Features

- Add, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Persistent storage (local storage)
- Blossom-themed UI with pink & stylish elements

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- State Management: React Context API
- Styling: CSS Modules / TailwindCSS (Blossom-themed color scheme)
- Data Handling: Local storage
